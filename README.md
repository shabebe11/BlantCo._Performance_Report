The Blant Co. Performance Report is a data analytics project built using Excel and Power BI to deliver a clear, visual overview of the company’s sales performance. It begins by cleaning and organising raw sales data—removing duplicates, handling missing entries, and categorising information by country and product. The processed data is then visualised in an interactive Power BI dashboard, allowing users to easily track year-to-date and previous-year-to-date sales, quantity sold, and gross profit. The report includes monthly trend charts and segmentation plots, helping stakeholders understand performance patterns across different markets. It also highlights the bottom 10 performing countries, giving managers a focused view of areas needing improvement and enabling data-driven decision-making.
